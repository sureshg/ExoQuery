/**
 * The purpose of this test was to originally test a bug that occurred when we had a
 * where-clause combined with a sub-table in a variable called "user" where the
 * child table also had a "user" column. An extra clause was added into SqlIdiom
 * as a band-aid in order to make sure the synthesis worked even in the case where
 * the `exo_synth_sxw` variable (that should never be used but was) is revealed and
 * and when the XR.Property `exo_synth_sxw.user` was tokenized it created the invalid
 * construct `exo_synth_sxw.` (i.e. nothing after the "."). This issue was resolved
 * by adding a missing `!alias.isUnused()` (in the 2nd dealias clause of the Dealias phase).
 * However, I decided to leave in the band-aid code in case the problem manifests again.

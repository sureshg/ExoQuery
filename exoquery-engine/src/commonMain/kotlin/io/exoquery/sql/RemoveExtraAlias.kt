  // Note that in many cases e.g. tuple names _1,_2 etc... the column name will be rarely changed,
  // as a result of column capitalization, however it is possible that it will be changed as a result
  // of some other scheme (e.g. adding 'col' to every name where columns actually named _1,_2 become col_1,col_2)
  // and then unless the proper alias is there (e.g. foo.col_1 AS _1, foo.col_2 AS _2) subsequent selects will incorrectly
  // select _1.foo,_2.bar fields assuming the _1,_2 columns actually exist.
  // However, in situations where the actual column name is Fixed, these kinds of things typically
  // will not happen so we do not force the alias to happen.
  // Note that in certain situations this will happen anyway (e.g. if the user overwrites the tokenizeFixedColumn method
  // in SqlIdiom. In those kinds of situations we allow specifying the -Dquill.query.alwaysAlias

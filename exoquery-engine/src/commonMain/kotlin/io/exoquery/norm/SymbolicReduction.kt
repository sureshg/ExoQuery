         * This transformation does not have an analogue in Wadler's paper, it represents the fundamental nature of the Monadic 'bind' function
         * that A.flatMap(a => B).flatMap(b => C) is isomorphic to A.flatMap(a => B.flatMap(b => C)).
         *
         * a.flatMap(b => c).flatMap(d => e) =>
         *     a.flatMap(b => c.flatMap(d => e))

         * case FlatMap(FlatMap(a, b, c), d, e) =>
         *     Some(FlatMap(a, b, FlatMap(c, d, e)))
         *
         * Note that in practice there is a caveat here in that if this transformation causes FlatJoins to be both in head and body position
         * then the SelectQuery transformer will not be able to propertly constuct it (there is a check there in flattenContexts that assures it).
         * The problem stems from having the construct FlatMap(..., FlatMap(Map(FlatJoin, ...)), Map(FlatJoin, ...)) which is not a valid construct
         * for the sake a query construction. Now recall that if you have something like FlatMap( FlatMap(ent, Map(FlatJoin)) , Map(FlatJoin))
         * (P.S. which is something like ent.flatMap(a => a.flatMap(join(b))).map(join(c)) (**) and proceed to flatten it out to
         * FlatMap(ent, FlatMap(Map(FlatJoin), Map(FlatJoin)) then you will have a problem because the FlatJoin in the
         * head and body positions of the inner FlatMap. Therefore we need to check that the head and body of the outer FlatMap do not have both have
         * flatJoins in order to proceed with this transformation.
         * (**) This is typically produced by using a sql.select clause, see "variable deconstruction should work even when passed to further join" in
         * VariableReductionReq.kt for an example. Also the MonadicMachinerReq has lots of examples of this.
         *
         * The only exception to this rule if the head of the inner FlatMap has a XR.Map in the tail position (which is actually the most common case).
         * In that case we have some special handling in SqlQueryHelper.flattenDualHeadsIfPossible to make it work.
         *
         * For example, let's say we have:
         * people.flatMap(p => join(addr, p.id).map(a => (p, a)))
         *   .flatMap(kv => join(robot, kv._1.id).map(r => ...))
         *
         * In SQL-DSL land that is:
         * select {
         *   kv = from( select { p = from(people); a = join(addr).on(p.id...) } )
         *   r = join(robot).on(kv._1.id...)
         * }
         *
         * This transformation will turn it into:
         * people
         *   .flatMap(p =>
         *     join(addr, p.id...).map(a => (p, a))
         *     .flatMap(kv => join(robot, kv._1.id).map(r => ...))
         *
         * This would be something like:
         * select {
         *    p = from(people)
         *    kv = from(
         *      select {
         *        a = join(addr).map(a => (p, a)) // <- Not a valid clause!
         *        r = join(robot).on(p.id...)
         *        (a.second to r)
         *      }
         *    )
         *
         * This of course is not valid-sql because a join cannot be the 1st part of a seelct statement. This is actually
         * a significant difference from the Monadic paradigm to SQL, and because of it `join(table) on(cond)` is not
         * exactly eqivalent to `table.filter(cond)`. For the specific above case however (i.e. where the `join(addr, p.id...).map(a => (p, a))` expression
         * exists above, since the head-position is just a XR.Map(XR.Join(...)) clause we can pull out the Join and flatten the whole query.
         * See SqlQueryHelper for more details on how that is done.
